#Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

##Overview 
This project is focused on predicting stock prices using linear regression. The goal is to analyze historical stock data and build a model that can forecast future stock prices based on relevant features.

## Data
The project utilizes historical stock data from ['Quandl']. The dataset includes various features such as [Adj. Open,Adj. High,Adj. Low,Adj. Close, Adj. Volume].

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing linear regression to predict stock prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Results
The Model shows the valus of stock prices (forecast_set) for days (forecast_out). The ggplot graph has been displayed in order to understand the shifting of values by the day.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the notebook `Linear Regression on Stock prices.ipynb` to see the data analysis and model implementation.

## Future Improvements
1. Incorporating more advanced machine learning algorithms.
2. Enhancing feature selection and engineering techniques.
3. Deploying the model for real-time predictions.
